# BisayaLang
The original purpose of bisaya lang was actually for me(the author) 
to create a working programming language, that is **turing-complete**.
And with the current state of bisaya lang, I can say that i have achieved my goal.
but the problem is, is that i dont know if im going to keep working on this project.
since I want to create a compiled programming language using LLVM or transpiling to c++.
